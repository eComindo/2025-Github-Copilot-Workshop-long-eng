## Slides

### 1. Preparation  (= = = = = DONE = = = = =)
- Remove custom github mcp server slide
- Add to pre-requisite instead: install [Github MCP Server](https://github.com/mcp/github/github-mcp-server) in VSCode

### 2. Copilot Space (= = = = = DONE = = = = =)

- start from the Copilot Space?
- add image and document about Pomodoro to Copilot Space
- use Copilot Space to ask questions about the project
- use Copilot Space to generate the plan.md file

### 3. Prompt File and Custom Agents (= = = = = DONE = = = = =)
- create prompt file: eg. unit test, code explainer
- create pre-built agents (already in the repo's `.github/`): eg. API agent, documentation maker
- create a custom agent: eg. Readme specialist

### 4. Custom Instruction (= = = = = DONE = = = = =)
- prebuilt custom instruction
- modify custom instruction, eg. to always add documentation to all new function (this should be just before the "Create Issue" slide)

### 5. Advanced Agent Interaction (Agent HQ)
- basically show the Copilot online's Agent tab to show the agent's activities
- add a new task (eg. add logging feature) from the Agents' tab while another agent is working on the previous issue

### 6. Code Review Agent
- Ask an agent to do a review
- Ask agent to generate unit tests to improve overall Code Quality. So we need to check code quality BEFORE and AFTER the prompt
- Just provide screenshots, to make sure non-enterprise account users can see the feature in action

### 7. Azure integration ???
- publish to Azure using Copilot Chat
